# DS2-2023-Project2 - Tropical Cyclones Data Analysis
Project 2 for class on Big Data &amp; Cloud Computing for Oceanography

You can get the presentation of our project [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T1GN83oDeq2XbQCyqaDU1HbPymp9mtcHhK3Ai4ZJkAg/edit?usp=sharing)
## User guide
Most of the notebooks need to be run on Google Colab, in order to use BigQuery magic cells to request data.
You also need to create a `./data` folder, with the csv that are currently in this repository.

List of the notebooks, corresponding to each part of our project : 
- __Method 1 - Cyclone detection on SST time series :__ [cyclone_detection_method_1.ipynb](./cyclone_detection_method_1.ipynb)

- __Method 2 - Cyclone detection on SST spatial variation :__ [Gulf_Mexico_method2.ipynb](./Gulf_Mexico_method2.ipynb) & [Japan_method2.ipynb](./Japan_method2.ipynb)

- __Descriptive analysis on the cyclones dataset :__ [ibtracs-analysis.ipynb](./ibtracs-analysis.ipynb) (doesn't need to be run on Colab)

- __Cyclone prediction :__ [cyclone-prediction.ipynb](./cyclone-prediction.ipynb)
